## Introduction

We are introducing a new version of the Sendbird UIKit. Version 3 features a new modular architecture with more granular components that give you enhanced flexibility to customize your web and mobile apps. Check out our [migration guides](/changelogs/MIGRATIONGUIDE_V3.md) and download [our samples](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-uikit-android/tree/main/uikit-samples)

Sendbird UIKit for Android is a development kit with an user interface that enables an easy and fast integration of standard chat features into new or existing client apps. This repository houses the UIKit source code in addition to two samples as explained below. 

- **uikit** is where you can find the open source code. Check out [UIKit Open Source Guidelines](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-uikit-android-sources/blob/main/OPENSOURCE_GUIDELINES.md) for more information regarding our stance on open source.
- **uikit-samples** consists of four use cases of UIKit.
You can navigate to each use case through the four menus that appear when you run it.
  * Basic Usage - A sample that contains the basic usage of UIKit. Please check the [README](uikit-samples/src/main/java/com/sendbird/uikit/samples/basic/README.md) for details.
  * Customizations - Examples that have applied customization to UIKit. Please check the [README](uikit-samples/src/main/java/com/sendbird/uikit/samples/customization/README.md) for details.
  * AI Chatbot: You can chat with the AI Chatbot running on the Sendbird platform.
It is disabled by default, To enable it, please check the [README](uikit-samples/src/main/java/com/sendbird/uikit/samples/aichatbot/README.md) for details.
  * Sendbird Notification: You can try out Sendbird's Notification product in this sample.
    It is disabled by default. To enable it, please check the [README](uikit-samples/src/main/java/com/sendbird/uikit/samples/notification/README.md) for details.
    Caution: This sample is not related to push notifications. It is a demonstration of Sendbird's Notification product.

## Before getting started

This section shows you the prerequisites you need for testing Sendbird UIKit for Android sample apps.

### Requirements

The minimum requirements for UIKit for Android are:

- Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher 
- Java 8 or higher
- Support androidx only 
- Android Gradle plugin 4.0.1 or higher
- Sendbird Chat SDK for Android 4.0.3 and later

### Try the sample app using your data 

If you would like to try the sample app specifically fit to your usage, you can do so by replacing the default sample app ID with yours, which you can obtain by [creating your Sendbird application from the dashboard](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v4/android/quickstart/send-first-message#3-install-and-configure-the-chat-sdk-4-step-1-create-a-sendbird-application-from-your-dashboard). Furthermore, you could also add data of your choice on the dashboard to test. This will allow you to experience the sample app with data from your Sendbird application.

## Getting started

This section explains the steps you need to take before testing the sample apps.

### Create a project

Go to your `Android Studio` and create a project for UIKit for Android in the **Project window** as follows:

1. In the **Welcome to Android Studio** window, click **Start a new Android Studio project**.
2. In the **Select a Project Template** window, select **Empty Activity**, and click **Next**.
3. Enter your project name in the **Name** field in the **Configure your project** window.
4. Select your language as either **Java** or **Kotlin** from the **Language** drop-down menu.
5. Enable `Use androidx.*artifacts`.
6. Select minimum API level as 21 or higher.

### Install UIKit for Android

UIKit for Android is installed via `Gradle`. Begin by opening the project's top-level `build.gradle` file and adding code blocks as below:

> Note: Add the code blocks in your root `build.gradle` file, not your module `build.gradle` file.

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        maven { url "https://repo.sendbird.com/public/maven" }
    }
}
```

If using Gradle 6.8 or higher, add the following to your `settings.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        maven { url "https://repo.sendbird.com/public/maven" }
    }
}
```



Then, open the `build.gradle` file at the application level. For `Java` and `Kotlin`, add code blocks and dependencies as below:

> Note: View binding should be enabled in your `build.gradle` file.

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {    
    buildFeatures {
        viewBinding true
    }
    
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.sendbird.sdk:uikit:LATEST_VERSION'
}
```

After saving your `build.gradle` file, click the **Sync** button to apply all the changes.
